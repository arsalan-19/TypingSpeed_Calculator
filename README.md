# TypingSpeed_Calculator

I was trying to increase my typing speed. I checked on the internet for free resources.
However, they were providing the sentence and asking me to just type. I wanted to add my own text and check the typing speed and overall sentence accuracy. 

This is just a basic code to calculate the typing speed and accuracy. 
I have added a sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" which contains all alphabets in the English language to type repeatedly and to make my fingers used to the character positioning on the keyboard.

This code will first ask you how many times you want to practice the same text.
As soon as you provide the number of practice times.
Then press enter to start typing, once you see the prompt "START!...".
This code will loop through the sentence and will provide you with the results each time you complete the sentence.

This helped me improve my typing speed to above average.
Hope this helps others too.
